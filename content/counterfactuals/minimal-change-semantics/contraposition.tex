\olsection{cnt}{min}{cpo}{Contraposition}

Material and strict conditionals are equivalent to their
contrapositives. Counterfactuals are not.  Here is an example due to
Kratzer:
\begin{quote}
  If Goethe hadn't died in 1832, he would (still) be dead now.

  If Goethe weren't dead now, he would have died in 1832.
\end{quote}
The first sentence is true: humans don't live hundreds of years.  The
second is clearly false: if Goethe weren't dead now, he would be still
alive, and so couldn't have died in 1832.

\begin{ex}\ollabel{ex:contraposition-counterex}
  The sphere semantics invalidates contraposition, i.e., we have $p
  \cif q \Entails/ \lnot q \cif \lnot p$. Think of $p$ as ``Goethe
  didn't die in 1832'' and $q$ as ``Goethe is dead now.'' We can
  capture this in a model $\mModel{M_1} = \tuple{W, O, V}$ with $W =
  \{w, w_1, w_2\}$, $O = \{\{w\}, \{w, w_1\}, \{w, w_1, w_2\}\}$,
  $V(p) = \{w_1, w_2\}$ and $V(q) = \{w, w_1\}$. So $w$ is the actual
  world where Goethe died in 1832 and is still dead; $w_1$ is the
  (close) world where Goethe died in, say, 1833, and is still dead;
  and $w_2$ is a (remote) world where Goethe is still alive.

There is a $p$-admitting sphere $S =
\{w, w_1\}$ and $p \lif q$ is true at all worlds in it, so $\mSat{M}{p
  \cif q}[w]$. However, the $\lnot q$-admitting sphere $\{w, w_1,
w_2\}$ contains a world, namely~$w_2$, where $q$ is false and $p$ is
true, so $\mSat/{M}{\lnot q \lif \lnot p}[w_2]$.
