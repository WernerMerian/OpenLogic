\olsection{nml}{fil}{euc}{Filtrations of Euclidean Models}

The approach of \olref[acc]{sec} does not work in the case of models
that are euclidean or serial and euclidean. Consider the model at the
top of \olref{fig:ser-eucl}, which is both euclidean and serial. Let
$\Gamma = \{p, \Box p \}$. When taking a filtration through $\Gamma$,
then $[w_1] = [w_3]$ since $w_1$ and $w_3$ are the only worlds that
agree on~$\Gamma$. Any filtration will also have the arrow inherited
from $\mModel{M}$, as depicted in \olref{fig:ser-eucl2}. That model
isn't euclidean. Moreover, we cannot add arrows to that model in order
to make it euclidean. We would have to add double arrows between
$[w_2]$ and $[w_4]$, and then also between $w_2$ and~$w_5$. But $\Box
p$ is supposed to be true at~$w_2$, while $p$ is false at~$w_5$.

In particular, to obtain a euclidean filtration it is not enough to
consider filtrations through arbitrary $\Gamma$'s closed under
sub-!!{formula}s. Instead we need to consider sets $\Gamma$ that are
\emph{modally closed} (see \olref[pre]{defn:modallyclosed}). Such sets
of sentences are infinite, and therefore do not immediately yield a
finite model property or the decidability of the corresponding system.

\begin{thm}\ollabel{thm:modal-closed-filt}
  Let $\Gamma$ be modally closed, $\mModel{M}=\tuple{W,R,V}$, and
  $\mModel{M^*} = \tuple{W^*,R^*,V^*}$ be a coarsest filtration of
  $\mModel{M}$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $\mModel{M}$ is symmetric, so is $\mModel{M^*}$.
  \item If $\mModel{M}$ is transitive, so is $\mModel{M^*}$.
  \item If $\mModel{M}$ is euclidean, so is $\mModel{M^*}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $\mModel{M^*}$ is a coarsest filtration, then by definition
    $R^*[u][v]$ holds if and only if $C_1(u,v)$. For transitivity,
    suppose $C_1(u,v)$ and $C_1(v,w)$; we have to show
    $C_1(u,w)$. \iftag{prvBox}{Suppose $\mSat{M}{\Box !A}[u]$; then
      $\mSat{M}{\Box\Box!A}[u]$ since \Ax{4} is valid in all
      transitive models; since $\Box\Box!A \in \Gamma$ by closure,
      also by $C_1(u,v)$, $\mSat{M}{\Box!A}[v]$ and by $C_1(v,w)$,
      also $\mSat{M}{!A}[w]$. }{}\iftag{prvDiamond}{Suppose
      $\mSat{M}{!A}[w]$; then $\mSat{M}{\Diamond !A}[v]$ by
      $C_1(v,w)$, since $\Diamond !A \in \Gamma$ by modal closure. By
      $C_1(u,v)$, we get $\mSat{M}{\Diamond\Diamond !A}[u]$ since
      $\Diamond\Diamond!A \in \Gamma$ by modal closure. Since
      $\Ax{4}_\Diamond$ is valid in all transitive models,
      $\mSat{M}{\Diamond!A}[u]$.}{}
  \item Exercise. Use the fact that both \Ax{5} and $\Ax{5_\Diamond}$
    are valid in all euclidean models.
  \item Exercise. Use the fact that \Ax{B} and $\Ax{B_\Diamond}$ are
    valid in all symmetric models.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
