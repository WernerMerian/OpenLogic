\olsection{sth}{ordinals}{zfm}{$\ZFminus$: a milestone}

The question of how to justify Replacement (if at all) is not
straightforward. As such, we will reserve that for
\olref[replacement][]{chap}. However, with the addition of Replacement, we
have reached another important milestone. We now have all the axioms
required for the theory $\ZFminus$. In detail:

\begin{defn}
The theory $\ZFminus$ has these axioms: Extensionality, Union, Pairs,
Powersets, Infinity, and all instances of the Separation and
Replacement schemes. Otherwise put, $\ZFminus$ adds Replacement to
$\Zminus$.
\end{defn}
\noindent
This stands for \emph{Zermelo--Fraenkel} set theory (\emph{minus}
something which we will come to later). Fraenkel gets the honour,
since he is credited with the formulation of Replacement in
\cite{Fraenkel1922}, although the first precise formulation was
due to \cite{Skolem1922}.
