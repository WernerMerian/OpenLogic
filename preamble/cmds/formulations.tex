% Commands for uniform formulations
% =================================

% Inductive definitions
% ---------------------

% Inductive definitions typically divide into cases depening on the
% form of a formula for which a concept if defined.  To uniformly
% typeset these definitions flexibly, we provide a command
% `\indcase{formula}{complex formula}{case text}` which (a) typesets a
% uniform description of a case and (b) defines `\indfrm` and
% `\indcomplex` which can then be used in the definitions. For
% instance, in an inductive definition of $\models A$, you might say
% `\indcase{A}{B \land C}{$\models \indfrm$ iff $\models B$ and
	% $\models C$}` to produce: "If $A \equiv B \land C$, then $\models A$
% iff $\models B$ and $\models C$" or, alternatively and more
% succinctly: "$\models B \land C$ iff $\models B$ and $\models C$".
% Use the starred version for the atomic case, and a ! instead of the
% star for a case you want to leave as an exercise.
