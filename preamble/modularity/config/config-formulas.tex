% % The Default OLP Configuration File `open-logic-config.sty`

% Description
% ===========
%
% This file contains all commands and environments that are meant to
% be configured, changed, or adapted by a user generating their own
% text based on OLP text.  **Do not edit this file to customize your
% OLP-derived text!** A file `myversion.tex` adapted from
% `open-logic-complete.tex` (or from any of the contributed example
% master files) will include `myversion-config.sty` if it exists. It
% will do so after it loads this file, so your `myversion-config.sty`
% will redefine the defaults.  This means you won't have to include
% everything, e.g., you can just change some tags and nothing else. You
% may copy and paste definitions you want to change into that file, or
% copy thi file, rename it `myversion-config.sty` and delete anything
% you'd like to leave as the default.

% Formula metavariabes 
% --------------------
%
% Use the exclamation point symbol `!` immediately in front of an
% uppercase letter in math mode for formula metavariables.  By
% default, `!A`, `!B`, ... are typeset as $\varphi$, $\psi$, $\chi$,
% ... if you use the command `\olgreekformulas`. If this is not desired,
% and you'd like $A$, $B$, $C$, ... instead, use `\ollatinformulas`.
% If you issue `\olalphagreekformulas`, you'll get $\alpha$, $\beta$,
% $\gamma$, \dots.

\olgreekformulas

% Greek symbols: prefer varphi and varepsilon

\let\oldphi\phi
