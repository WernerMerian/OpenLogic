#Â Downloading OLT

To download the [LaTeX](./latex.md) source code, either [clone the git repository](./git.md) or download it as a ZIP file using the [download link on the right](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/archive/master.zip) of the [repository view page](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic).

You can download PDFs of the most recent version at the [OLT nightly build site](http://builds.openlogicproject.org/). It contains PDFs of the complete text (open-logic[-*].pdf) and of the individual sections.
