# Formulas

`sty/open-logic-formulas.sty` provides `!` as an active character for formula (meta)variables. `!A`, `!B`, `!C` etc. can be used to produce `\phi`, `\psi`, `\chi`, ..., or alternatively `A`, `B`, `C`, ...

`\phi`, `\psi`, `\chi`, ... is the default and is turned on by `\olgreekformulas` in your configuration file. If you want `A`, `B`, `C`, ... instead, say `\ollatinformulas` in your preamble or in your configuration file. You can also get `\alpha`, `\beta`, `\gamma`, ... with `\olalphagreekformulas`.
