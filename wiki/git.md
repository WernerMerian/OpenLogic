# Git

Git is a revision control system, and the Open Logic Project is hosted on the Git server [GitHub](http://github.com/).

A basic introduction to Git for non-programmers is:

[Git for Philosophers](https://github.com/rzach/git4phi/blob/master/git4phi.md)

The following link has information on installing and using Git on Mac, Windows, and Linux:

[https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

The download may also be obtained there. You will want to have a GitHub account already set up.

Once you have Git installed, you can download the OLT [LaTeX](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/wiki/LaTeX) source using
```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic.git
```
If you plan to make additions or improvements to the code which you'd like to contribute to the project, you should first fork the OLP repository and then clone it, as described under [Contributing](./contributing.md).
